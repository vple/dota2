# Slark

## Playstyle Overview

- Slippery hero, likes to weave in and out of teamfights to quickly heal up and allow his cooldowns to reset.
  - Drawn out, scrappy teamfights are where Slark excels.
  - Also likes to pick off squishy, out of position heroes.
- Killing Slark usually requires correctly timing chain disables. If Slark manages to Dark Pact, or use his ultimate, it's much harder for a gank attempt to succeed.
- Has bonus night vision and can detect when he's in enemy vision, making it much harder to get the jump on Slark.

## Gameplay

### Farming

- Dark Pact is a built in farming tool, allowing Slark to clear waves and camps reasonably quickly.

### Itemization

#### As Slark

- There are a few main priorities for Slark when itemizing.
  - Mana Regen 
    - Why: Slark gradually uses up his mana while farming, and so appreciates an early item that gives some mana.
      - Echo Sabre is generally the go-to item, as it also helps Slark with other aspects.
  - Mobility 
    - Why: Slark needs a way to gap close in order to get on top of his preferred targets in fights. It also helps to have an escape tool.
      - Shadow Blade and Blink Dagger are the go-to options here.
        - Shadow Blade gives damage and attack speed, which are both good. Slark can also heal while invisible, provided the enemy has no detection.
        - Shadow Blade still requires walking into the enemy. Slark has to be wary of detection.
        - Blink Dagger allows Slark to jump any target. This mobility is stronger than Shadow Blade, but Blink Dagger provides nothing to Slark outside of this active.
      - Move speed is nice, but not a strict requirement.
  - Survivability
    - Why: Slark mainly needs to survive any potential burst during fights.
      - If he doesn't get bursted (or locked down), Slark can move out of vision or use Shadow Dance to heal up. This effectively wastes Slark's opponents' spells.
    - Stats are Slark's primary way of being survivable. Stats are the generic answer to the opposing team's damage.
    - BKB and Linken's Sphere are used to avoid getting locked down.
      - BKB allows Slark to stand his ground and fight, particularly when Dark Pact is on cooldown. It is very useful against teams with lots of stuns or silences, as it is very hard to kill Slark when he isn't disabled.
      - Linken's Sphere is good against single-target disable _that Slark cannot Dark Pact off_, such as Doom or Duel.
  - Attack Speed
    - Why: Slark doesn't need to focus on raw damage as he gains damage over time through Essence Shift. He wants attack speed to maximize the benefits of Essence Shift.
    - Buying an item purely for attack speed is usually a luxury for Slark, as he should be more focused on survivability. Typically, Slark will buy attack speed items that also give him other benefits.
    - Common Items
      - Echo Sabre
      - Shadow Blade
      - Yasha --> Sange & Yasha
      - Moon Shard (Luxury)
      - Swift Blink (Luxury)
  - Anti-Escape
  
#### Against Slark

- Sentry Wards (or Gem of True Sight) are a must if Slark buys a Shadow Blade. Dust of Appearance is much less useful against Slark.
  - Slark uses Shadow Blade to initiate, against which you need sentries.
  - Slark can use Dark Pact to remove Dust, making it much harder to time your Dust usage.
- Force Staff allows you to break an ally out of Pounce.
- Instant disables (Orchid Malevolence, Scythe of Vyse) allow you to jump Slark and prevent him from using Dark Pact.

### Common Patterns

- Slark will often gap close on a target with Blink or Shadow Blade, followed by an immediate Pounce and Dark Pact.
  - As Slark, you must decide whether or not to commit to fighting if you cannot kill during the Dark Pact.
    - Committing makes sense if the enemy has no backup and no way to kill you once Dark Pact ends.
    - Especially in teamfights, committing will involve using BKB and/or Shadow Dance.
    - If you are not committing, you likely want to start backing away before Dark Pact finishes. This gets you out of range of counter-initiation.
  - Against Slark, expect a Dark Pact after his Pounce. Save your disable until after the Dark Pact finishes.
- Shadow Dance > TP.
  - This allows Slark to get out of dangerous situations, as long as the opponent does not have an AoE disable to cancel the TP.
  - If you have a BKB, Shadow Dance > BKB > TP gets you out of almost everything.

## Skills

### Dark Pact

- Dark Pact purges Dust of Appearance.
  - When using Shadow Blade to escape, try to use Dark Pact immediately before the Shadow Blade. If your opponent uses Dust too early, it will get purged and you can safely run away while invisible.

### Pounce

- Landing Pounce is practically guaranteed if you use it immediately after landing an attack.
- Cancels TPs.
- Can be used like a force staff to help you escape, especially over impassable terrain.
- You can body block Slark, preventing him from using Pounce to escape. He'll leash you instead.

### Essence Shift

### Shadow Dance

- The passive ability helps you find enemy wards.
  - You should let your team know where enemy wards are. This lets you remove more vision and helps your supports save money since they no longer need to guess where your opponents have vision.
  - It's also useful to carry your own sentries. The deward will give you gold. Also, your team may not be able to get to where the enemy ward is.
- In fights, you often want to hide out of vision as you wait for Dark Pact to cool down. This lets you heal up and re-engage.
